### Hi there 👋
I am Yuyu, I'm a **front end developer** from Taiwan. I majored Biomedical Sciences during my uni life, when I started a intern program at a pharmaceutical company, I spent lots of time using computer and then discovered that I hate doing repeatedly work. So, I started learning basic software language online by myself and found out its posibility is just what I want! :D

## My values
  🎊 Trying new things to find inspiration or connection.
  
  🙈 Beginner's mindset and curiosity.
  
  👯 Care about sharing and teamwork.
  
  👀 Often think about the functions played by different roles.
  
  🎯 It's important that things can be clearly and simply expressed.
  
## Get in touch
  In holidays, I love to spend time in nature.\
  I have a blog records experiences that refresh my mind. It's about travel, volunteering, zerowaste, and some botanical illustrations.
